    <p id="paragraph">
      Hi! I am a first year Computer Science major with a concentration in Info/Internetworks and Intelligence. I am from Cary, NC and my high school is Green Level High School. Like any other average community member, I was taught to help a disabled person any chance I got. But, after working closely with five long-term clients at the DAC, the “don’t praise a person with a disability for having the courage” rule left me dumbstruck. One month of my internship challenged a lifetime’s worth of etiquette when it came to communicating with people with disabilities. I learned that in an inclusive community, no one is defined by their disabilities and since then I’ve been committed to live out my vision of an inclusive community through my involvement with the DAC. Some of my hobbies include ready, watching Netflix, and listening to music. A place I really want to visit is Monte Carlo, Monaco. My favorite album is Lover by Taylor Swift. A fun fact about me is that I am currently OBSESSED with watching Formula 1.
